## Abstract
Humor is an important factor in communication. In natural language processing, significant efforts have been devoted toward training models in humor through humor classification, recognition, and detection tasks. However, the difficulty of collecting humorous sentences and the subjectivity of humor are among the numerous limitations of developing models. As no existing Korean humor dataset currently exists, this study introduced the first Korean humor dataset, the KoHaHa. We collected ‚ÄòÏç∞(Ssul)‚Äô genres from online sources and attempted to address the problem of subjectivity in humor by applying an approach to humor labeling that differed from those of other datasets. We also used KoHaHa to explore the possibility of humor transferability to large language models through GPT-3.5 and fine-tuning. The results of the A/B test demonstrated that the fine-tuned model using the KoHaHa dataset learned Korean humor forms. However, GPT-3.5 was evaluated to be high for humorous meaning relevance, confirming the limitations of humor transfer.
